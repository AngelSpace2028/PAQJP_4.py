I am eager to return to university to obtain a Bachelor’s degree, with my first preference being 
Dublin City University to study DC123– Data Science. This programme aligns with my long term goal of becoming a dedicated and inspiring Data Science and Databases teacher. 
As someone with Asperger’s Syndrome, I bring unique strengths to education, including a 
high IQ, strong logical reasoning, and the ability to focus on complex problems for extended 
periods. These qualities have helped me excel in technical areas, particularly computer 
science and cybersecurity.
My academic background includes: 
Cisco Networking Academy – Cybersecurity 
Year 1 and part of Year 2 in Computer Science at TU Dublin 
Special Purpose Award Web Development at CCT College 
QQI Level 5 Certificates in English, Business, and IT at Plunket College PC 
Specialist Course at Whitehall College of Further Education 
Through these studies, I have gained valuable technical knowledge and programming skills. I 
am proficient in Microsoft Office, HTML, CSS, Java, C, C Plus Plus, Pascal, Python, PHP, 
SQL, VB, JavaScript, and more. While I have a strong foundation in computing, I have come 
to realise that my true calling is teaching Data Science and helping others learn and gain 
confidence with data and logic. 
As a mature student, I bring life experience, discipline, and purpose. I have learned to work 
both independently and collaboratively, to solve problems methodically, and to stay motivated 
in challenging situations. My goal is not only to gain knowledge, but to use it to help future 
students succeed in school and in life. 
I have a deep appreciation for Data Science and Databases. Data Science offers a logical and 
universal framework for understanding complex systems and making evidence-based 
decisions. Databases, as the foundation for storing and organizing information, are essential to 
the effective application of data science. Together, they enable the extraction of meaningful 
insights from vast amounts of data. I believe that teaching these subjects not only develops 
analytical thinking but also promotes mental discipline, confidence, and resilience—qualities 
that are vital for students in both academic and real-world contexts.
I believe Dublin City University is the ideal environment for me to grow as a future teacher. 
The university’s reputation for high-quality teacher training and its commitment to personal 
development align perfectly with my goals. I am committed to building a meaningful career 
in education, helping students not only learn but believe in themselves. 
Someday, a student who struggles with Data Science will succeed—because of me. That is 
the future I am working toward. 
Thank you for considering my application. 
My hobbies reflect my creativity and focus. I enjoy writing compression software in my free 
time, walking in the National Botanic Gardens, taking photographs, reading fantasy books, 
watching films, and listening to classic rock music. I play chess online every day and also 
enjoy basketball, which supports my interest in Physical Education.
