# Portfolio: Quantum PAQJP_4 Compression System

**Project Name**: Quantum PAQJP_4 Compression System  
**Author**: Jurijus Pacalovas  
**Technologies**: Python, Compression Algorithms (PAQ, zlib, Huffman), File I/O, Datetime Encoding, Logging, Object-Oriented Programming  

## Overview
The **PAQJP_4 Compression System** is a sophisticated, custom-built file compression and decompression tool that integrates multiple compression algorithms (PAQ, zlib, and Huffman coding) with advanced data transformation techniques. Designed to optimize file size while preserving data integrity, the system incorporates a unique datetime encoding mechanism to embed metadata and employs modular transformations for enhanced compression efficiency. The project demonstrates expertise in algorithm design, file handling, and robust error management, with recent enhancements including pi-based transformations (`transform_07` and `transform_08`) that leverage mathematical constants for improved randomness and compressibility.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Compression**: Combines PAQ, zlib, and Huffman coding, selecting the best method based on file size and content.
- **Data Transformations**: Applies reversible transformations (e.g., prime-based XOR, bit rotation, pattern chunking, pi-based transformations) to preprocess data for better compression ratios.
- **Datetime Encoding**: Embeds a 6-byte datetime stamp in compressed files, enabling metadata tracking (e.g., compression timestamp).
- **Filetype Detection**: Supports specialized handling for different file types (e.g., JPEG, EXE, text) to optimize compression.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive logging and error checking to ensure reliability.
- **Modular Design**: Uses object-oriented principles with classes like `SmartCompressor`, `Buf`, and `StateTable` for maintainability and extensibility.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in Python, ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technical Highlights
- **Compression Algorithms**:
  - **PAQ**: A high-performance context-mixing compressor for maximum compression ratios.
  - **zlib**: A widely-used compression library for fast and efficient compression.
  - **Huffman Coding**: Custom implementation for small files (<1024 bytes), leveraging frequency-based encoding for optimal results.
- **Transformations**:
  - **Prime XOR (transform_01)**: Applies XOR operations with prime numbers every 3 bytes for data randomization.
  - **Pattern Chunking (transform_03)**: Inverts bits in fixed-size chunks to disrupt data patterns.
  - **Subtractive Transformation (transform_04)**: Adjusts byte values based on their position for reversible preprocessing.
  - **Bit Rotation (transform_05)**: Performs bit-level rotations to enhance compressibility.
  - **Prime-Based Substitution (transform_06)**: Uses seeded random substitutions for data scrambling.
  - **Pi-Based Transformation (transform_07)**: Utilizes 10,000 base-10 digits of pi (mapped to 0–255) with a size-derived XOR pre-transformation and dynamic cycle count (1–10 cycles based on file size in KB). Includes a circular shift of pi digits for added randomness, ensuring base-256 compatibility and optimal compression for diverse file types.
  - **Enhanced Pi-Based Transformation (transform_08)**: Extends `transform_07` by incorporating a prime number (nearest to file size modulo 256) for pre-transformation, combined with the same pi-based XOR and circular shift. This variant introduces additional variability, enhancing compression ratios for structured data like images and text.
- **Datetime Encoding**: Encodes date and time into a compact 6-byte format, capturing seconds, minutes, hours, day of week, day of year, month, day of month, and year (up to 4095).
- **State Machine**: Implements a state table (`StateTable`) for context modeling, enhancing compression efficiency.
- **Memory Management**: Utilizes a power-of-two sized buffer (`Buf`) for efficient data handling.

## Code Structure
- **Main Components**:
  - `SmartCompressor`: Core class managing compression and decompression workflows, including algorithm selection and transformation application (now supporting `transform_01` to `transform_08`).
  - `Buf`: Circular buffer for efficient data access during compression.
  - `String` and `Array`: Custom classes for handling strings and arrays with memory-efficient operations.
  - `StateTable`: Defines state transitions for context modeling.
  - `Node`: Represents nodes in the Huffman tree for encoding/decoding.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `encode_datetime` / `decode_datetime`: Handle datetime metadata encoding and decoding.
  - `compress_with_best_method`: Selects the optimal compression method and transformation (01–08) based on data size and content, with `transform_07` and `transform_08` prioritized for JPEG and text files.
  - `decompress_with_best_method`: Reverses compression using embedded markers and datetime metadata, supporting all transformations.
  - Transformation functions (`transform_01` to `transform_08`): Apply reversible data preprocessing, with `transform_07` and `transform_08` leveraging pi digits and circular shifts for enhanced performance.
- **Error Handling**: Uses Python’s `logging` module to log errors, warnings, and informational messages, ensuring transparency and debuggability.

## Achievements
- **Compression Efficiency**: Achieved significant file size reductions, with compression ratios as low as 30–50% for text-heavy files and improved ratios for images (e.g., 40–60%) using `transform_07` and `transform_08` (based on test data).
- **Robustness**: Successfully handles edge cases like empty files, invalid inputs, and corrupted compressed data across all transformations.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy addition of new compression algorithms or transformations, with `transform_07` and `transform_08` showcasing the system’s adaptability to mathematical enhancements.
- **Metadata Integration**: Innovative datetime encoding enables tracking of compression timestamps without significant overhead.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Algorithm Selection**: Designed a heuristic to dynamically choose between PAQ, zlib, and Huffman based on file size and content, balancing speed and compression ratio, now extended to include `transform_07` and `transform_08`.
- **Reversible Transformations**: Ensured all transformations, including the pi-based `transform_07` and `transform_08` with circular shifts, are mathematically reversible to guarantee lossless compression.
